  <h2>Planned Tools</h2>
  <p>For this project, Python and R will likely be used to preprocess the data into a format suitable for use in D3. A prototype may be created in Tableau, in conjunction with Excel and/or other tools. Other JS libraries, such as <a href="http://dimplejs.org/index.html">dimple</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki">TopoJSON</a> may also be investigated.  </p>
  <h2>Planned Techniques</h2>
  <p>My hope for the project is to implement the following techniques: 
      <ol>
          <li><u>Projections/Geography</u>: Given that the dataset scope encompasses 197 countries, I hope to make use of the global topographic projection files that are available online. This would provide exposure to using geo-location maps within the D3 framework--something that I feel will be of use after the program. Providing a way for users to interact with a map projection to access the data would be great; however, I plan to at least use these maps navigationally for the project. Whether this manifests as a choropleth or as a navigation section will depend on the amount of work needed to get the desired effect. </li>
          <li><u>Small Multiples</u>: The data also has annual consumption by alcohol type. Given the number of data points and categories, I think small multiples would lend itself well here. Having a single view of all the countries' consumption rates will make understanding all the data much easier. My learning goal for this technique would be to balance the data:ink ratio while preventing user data overload. </li>
          <li><u>Animated Bubble Chart</u>: Similar Bostock's infamous reproduction of Hans Rosling's <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/">Wealth &amp; Health of Nations</a> chart, I think this data lends itself well to this kind of representation over time. Whether through this technique or something similar, my plan is to animate the changes of consumption--by type and by country--over the provided time period. The WHO website has more historical data and, if the visualization makes sense, I may get more data specifically to expand on the time component. Here, the learning goal is to understand how to create an automatic time series animation that allows for interactivity. </li>
      </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Planned Interaction</h2>
  <p>Of the many possible interactions, I intend to implement the following in a linked, unified fashion: 
      <ul>
          <li><u>Filtering</u>: by country, alcohol category, year, and/or continent</li>
          <li><u>Zooming></u>: in order to zoom into a region of the globe/projection</li>
          <li><u>Brushing</u>: if there are any time series components, it will include this for detail views</li>
          <li><u>Sorting</u>: here, again, users should be able to sort by country, region, year, or category</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Planned Interface</h2>
